I was living off our last talk
Fell asleep between the sidewalk
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
But I think I'm getting older
Late nights are early mornings
Bruises on my neck are boring
But I'm not the same I was before

I'm going far out

And I, I know that it is hard
The moments going fast
And when the tide it pulls me closer
Maybe I could be myself
And you could be the sea
Just promise that you'll pull me under
When I'm running out of air
And drowning isn't fair
Don't tell me that it's almost over
Oh, oh, oh

Well I'll wait around the car park
Cause you're sleeping when the suns up
Do you care, do you care, do you care, do you care
If I wake up with the sheets clean
And your company is comforting
But I'm scared I'll do the same thing
It's just another life wasted

Jesse said, let's go surfing again
Daylight makes it hard to pretend
Up late, doing drugs in your bed
I'm not here, I've been dreaming instead

Lets go surfing again
Sometime
Sometimes
I don't have any friends

Still waiting
Salt in your silhouette
And the beach still on my breath

Don't take the bus
I'm gonna take the bus
Is that the sound of love lost walking home
I'm gonna cut my hair
And move away somewhere
Come and find me if the morning comes

And I don't wanna go surfing again
You're to cool to be acting upset
I wanna leave, I don't wanna pay rent
Irresponsible, I think I'm better off dead

On the concrete
Give me some time to forget
About the beach still on your breath

If the morning comes

----

Thinking about you
Been going to the beach without you
I want to be like your last boyfriend
A fucking train wreck in your head

Do you wanna start over?
Got the weight of your world on my shoulders
I want to be like your new girlfriend
Another daydream painted red

In the backseat
We're going 90
To some Ramones song
I never learned how to play
Who wants to be okay?

You were the days and the nights in between
I was the holes I cut into my jeans
You were the winter, I was buried in the snow
But it's still too cold so the seeds won't grow

Been waking up alone without you
I want to be like your cigarettes
On your lips and in your head

Do you wanna sleepover?
I could cover my walls in your posters
I want to be like your old cassettes
Only use me when your phone is dead

You're riding shotgun
In September sun
Some old beach boys
To make you feel less young
You better start to run

----

That was the last time I ever saw your friends
Finding parliaments in my backseat
We were talking bout daylight coming through windows
Isn't that what love is made of?

I woke from a dream cause I knew you were listening
You thought I was sleeping but I'm not stupid
So I carved my name in the white of your eyes
Like isn't that what love is made of?

Living in the city sure gets lonely
When everyone you know is so damn busy
Living by the ocean I wanna go surfing
I'd go to the beach but I'm tired of learning

I'm insincere, and everything is fine
I'm running out of ways to get my name onto your lips
I'm insincere, and empty streets are fine
I'm running out of windows to sneak out of when you're lonely
I'm insincere, and I don't think you're fine
And two packs a day, they never made things any easier

----

It was after work you said
Just call me later
But you were planning to
Just blow me off again

You said you were ready to hang tonight
Now I'm stuck here waiting
You told me you were gonna pick me up at 8
Now you're saying that we're gonna be late, late

Just like I'm wasted all the time
You only waste time when it's mine
I think I'm gonna have to call it quits
This fucking dude is full of shit

(It was after work you said)
We're gonna be late
(Just call me later)

----

My throat is bleeding
I'm still breathing in
Gums receding
I just need something

Cause I've been known to hit the ground
And lately I've been feeling down
Thanks for letting me inside
Your living room the other night

Television statics dead
I'd like to wake up in your bed
We're running out of time to kill
I think I want to go home

Waiting for the train, standing on the track
When I say I love you, you don't have to say it back

It's not my fault I'm insecure
I've never been that good with words
And adjectives won't do enough
My god, you're just so pretty

It's not my fault I'm on the edge
I'm getting tired of making sense
And if I never change at all
Would you still think I'm pretty

Feeling sexy
Bright eyes on the bus
You can't arrest me
If I don't give a fuck

Okay I'm kidding, I'm not cool
Performative at breaking rules
Thanks for letting me inside
Your swimming pool the other night

You stood outside despite the rain
Mismatching socks to separate
Your dirty feet from underneath
Do I still make you happy?

I think that you're the train, baby I'm the track
When I say I love you, you don't have to say it back

But I don't wanna be pretty

Your nose is bleeding
Blood still on your breath
Take a picture
So you won't forget

----

Good morning, it's August 21, 2020
And once again, it's a Friday

I know it’s getting harder to hold on tight
Don’t forget it’s never better on the other side
My hands bleed first
My head still hurts
And I know that you were wrong
(Woo)

Another night that I don’t feel better
Another day that I'll blame the weather
Another night that I knew it all along
And I swear that you were wrong

----

I don't mind if you tell me that we need to start over
I’ll be fine if you tell me that we need to be cool
I don't mind if you wanna come over
And get high cause I never really know what to do

The morning will come soon
You killed the plants that are in my room
And I don't know what to do
Cause I think I’m still in love with you

And now it’s late and I’m so tired
Wish you could be just a little more quiet
Now it’s dark and I feel stupid
Throat in my chest when you wanna play cupid

Summer went and came
I heard it rained every night and every day in Virginia
Washed out photo tint
We moved to Philadelphia with all your shit in the back seat
Stuck inside the wave say that you’ll move to California in May
But I don't think that it’s enough

Now it’s dark and I feel stupid
Throat in my chest when you wanna play cupid

I don’t mind if you tell me that we need to start over
I’ll be fine if you tell me that we need to be cool
I don’t mind, I don’t mind, I don’t mind, I don’t mind
I get high cause I never really know what to do, never really know what to do
(Fuck, *coughs*)

----

Caroline I'm burying your footsteps
Backwoods on a back porch summer death
Dreaming when I wake up

Bitter tongue everything will end soon
Gray days in the graveyard 6th of June
(Dreaming when I wake up)

And when you’re back from the station
We can write some songs in your basement
Now you’re breaking my teeth down on I street
And we’re falling apart watching Twin Peaks

Are the Strokes still your favorite band
I don’t know you but I did
I just wish I knew the end
It’s not the same in Washington

The air is thin and I’m upset
Because I’m exactly the same as I was last summer

And all my friends are far away from home
I sink a little deeper when you're on the phone
My friends are far away from home

Goddamn I'm far away from home

----

Eventually you have to blink
Underwhelming everything

I never wanted to be anyone, I’d much prefer to leave
But all this time spent in my head has bummed me out permanently
Thought everything’d be different when you finally turned 23
Just cut me open let me drain and leave my body in the sea
In the sea

Eventually your hands will slip
Up and coming piece of shit

You haven’t cried in front of anyone since you were just a kid
But everything changes when you become a college graduate
Am I the only one who wishes we could just go back in time
To when our bones were breaking but it was okay cause you were mine
You were mine

I'm wearing dark glasses today because I'm seeing the future and it's looking very bright

Bad dreams are made to wake you up
Telling secrets in the bathroom aren't you?
Too drunk not having any fun
Am I the only one who hates this venue?

I don’t wanna know

40s in a gnarly parking lot
Not the type to want to argue, are you?
I played letting off the happiness
But that shits way too sad for you

I’m just feeling down

----

Oh my god I wish my life was a movie
Over in a couple of hours

And to be forgotten afterwards
I'm never gonna get sunburned again

But I was driving late with nowhere to be
Pretending all the songs I wrote to you mean anything to me
Now i’m in my room and I can’t leave
Forgive the flooding in the basement that will some day set me free

I'm not depressed
I’m just really fucking sad all the time
But I digress
Cause your hair still holds the salt from the ocean
(Everyday wished to stay in bed)

Oh my god I wish my life was a movie
Quiet for a couple of hours

And to be distracted all the time
I’m never gonna get bug bites again

And you were sleeping in with nothing to do
And every song that I sent to you
You already knew
I will listen to the cure on your shitty record player
Just as long as you can promise it won’t be this way forever

So depressed
And I don't want to be so sad all the time
I’ll try my best
To find you on the other side of the bright light

You’re the black in my coffee, you make me feel better
I swear I can feel you when I wear your sweaters
You’re 575 just like beautiful weather
Please stay alive cause you make me feel better

Black in my coffee, you make me feel better
Swear I can feel you when I wear your sweaters
